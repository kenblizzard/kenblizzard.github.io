    <h1>Hello, I'm Kenneth Bolico</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a Web Back-End and Front-End Developer. My main interest/skills are in Javascript technologies such as
        NodeJS, AngularJS, BackboneJS, JQuery, and many more, and NoSQL database like MongoDB. Also have experience and knowledge in other technologies like C#, 
        Java, Php, Laravel, PostgresSQL, MySQL etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am a very passionate developer. Learning new things is very addicting, so whenever an opportunity to learn comes, I grab it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pizza is LOVE. Code is LOVE.
